            "text": "Level 5 Unit 1 Part 1\n\n\nListening\n\n\nJessica\u2019s class reunion\n\n\nJessica is 35 years old. She graduated from middle school 20 years ago. This year her middle school class had its 20-year class reunion. All of her classmates and teachers were invited to attend. It was going to be at a hotel near where their school used to be. Like many other buildings the school had been torn down. It had been replaced by some apartment buildings.\n\n\nAt first, she wasn't sure if she could go to the reunion. One reason was that there wasn't anyone in particular that she wanted to see. Another reason was that she was very busy. She was a working mother with a boy 8- years old and a husband who was rarely at home. Going to the reunion meant that she would have to arrange for someone to take care of things while she was away. That wouldn't be easy. She didn't want to take her boy with her, and her husband wouldn't take time off from work.\n\n\nThen she got a message from Sharon, one of her old classmates. Sharon was contacting people from their class and urging everyone to come. In their schooldays, Sharon was class monitor and now she was helping to organize the reunion.\n\n\nNone of them had seen or heard from her since graduation. They were especially curious since she hadn't gone to their first reunion 10 years before.\n\n\nJessica decided to arrange things so that she could go.\n\n\nHer husband finally agreed to take care of things while she was away.\n\n\nHe agreed to do it because her mother had offered to come and stay for a while. So Jessica could attend the reunion.\n\n\nSince he and her mother didn't get along, he decided to change his schedule and work from home for a few days.\n\n\nHe really didn't want her mother to come though he didn't say so.\n\n\nWhen she got to the reunion, she was shocked everyone had aged so much and many were out of shape. Some who used to be good looking had lost their looks completely. And others looked much better than before. It was strange how time had changed people in such different ways. Anyway, she decided that since she was there she would try to enjoy it.\n\n\nVocabulary\n\n\nActions and change\n\n\nTo replace\n something means to put something else in its place when something gets old and begins to breakdown it may need to be replaced.  \n\nIf someone leave the company, the person may need to be replaced by someone else.  \n\n\nTo tear \nsomething down means to break it apart. To tear person down means to hurt them by saying negative things about them.  \n\nIt may take a long time to tear down a big building.  \n\n\u2026. Put it together. Large construction projects include buildings, bridges, and organizations. The opposite of constructive is destructive.   \n\nThe earthquake destroyed several buildings and left many people without homes.   \n\n\nTo organize\n something means to arrange things in an orderly, logical way. An organization is something that has a logical structure such as a well-managed company. Some people are poorly organized, so they have a hard time finding things.   \n\n\nTo support\n something, such as an idea, is to help or add strength to it. The opposite of support is to undermine or weekend. If you support someone it means you're trying to help them succeed.\n\n\nTypes of information\n\n\nPublic\n information is available to anyone who wants to know it. If the store is open to the public, it means anyone can come in. Many people make money by investing in public companies.   \n\n\nPrivate\n information is not open to everyone but is only available to trusted friends or family. Information about one secret hopes and dreams is usually private. The password to your bank account is private information. Confidential information is secret information.   \n\n\nConfidential\n information is not supposed to be shared with others. The details of the secret design or how a company makes decisions are often confidential.   \n\n\nGossip\n is information that is often exchanged, because it's exciting or fun. Even though it may not be true. Office gossip is often entertaining, but it can also be damaging. When people gossip, it may hurt someone by spreading false or embarrassing information.   \n\n\nOpinions\n are what people think or feel about something as opposed to factual information. Factual information is based on facts or evidence, but opinions are what people think or feel. Opinions often differ and when they do people may argue. \n\n\nDialogue\n\n\nA customer complaint\n\n\nM:\n Is this the ACE service center?   \n\n\nW:\n Yes, it is Sir. May I help you  \n\n\nM:\n I'm calling to complain about your service.   \n\n\nW:\n Certainly sir. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see if there's something I can do to help you. Please tell me what happened?   \n\n\nM:\n I ordered a new washing machine on your website. It was more than a week ago.   \n\n\nW:\n Before you go on, may I have your order number, please?   \n\n\nM:\n Sure, it\u2019s ABC 1005.   \n\nAnd may I have the last 4 digits of your Social Security number?   \n\n\nM:\n I don\u2019t have a social security number. I am an illegal alien.   \n\n\nW:\n Very funny Sir. Ok then. What is your first pets name?   \n\n\nM:\n Mr. Kitty.  \n\n\nW:\n OK. I see all of your information. Now what's the problem?   \n\n\nM:\n I ordered the washing machine and paid for it. Then I chose a delivery day from a set of choices. It was supposed to be delivered today, but it's still not here.   \n\n\nW:\n Did anyone contact you?   \n\n\nM:\n No, I haven't received any messages.   \n\n\nW:\n I'm sorry to hear that Sir. I see here that the washing machine you ordered hasn't arrived in our warehouse yet. It can't be delivered until next week.   \n\n\nM:\n You don't even have it yet?  \n\n\nM:\n Why haven't I been notified. I took time off from work to be at home today.   \n\n\nW:\n You should have been notified by phone or email.   \n\n\nM:\n I wasn't. I haven't received any notification. This is very upsetting.   \n\n\nW:\n I understand Sir. I'm really sorry for this.   \n\n\nM:\n Being sorry isn't enough. I'm really upset. This is no way to do business.   \n\n\nW:\n Yes, I understand. I can send you a $50 gift coupon as a way to express our appreciation for your patience.   \n\n\nM:\n I don't care about the money. I don't blame you of course, but I want you to know how disappointed I am with ace. I expected much better service.   \n\n\nW:\n I'm really sorry Sir. Is there anything else I can do for you?   \n\n\nM:\n Yes, there is. I'd like to cancel the order and get a refund.   \n\n\nW:\n I'm sorry to hear that Sir. But I understand. I'll see to it that you get your refund.   \n\n\nM:\n How long will it take before I get the refund?   \n\n\nW:\n You should see the credit on your next month's credit card billing statement.   \n\n\nM:\n Thanks for your help.   \n\n\nW:\n You're welcome Sir. and once again, please accept my apologies.",

            "text": "Level 5 Unit 1 Part 2\n\n\nListening\n\n\nAt Jessica\u2019s reunion party\n\n\nJessica's 20- year class reunion was held at a fancy hotel. When she arrived, she wasn't sure she was in the right place. At first, she didn't recognize anyone. And felt a bit awkward and out of place. But it wasn't long before a strange man came up to her. He was already losing his hair and he was wearing thick glasses. \u201cdon't you remember me ? \u201d he asked.    \n\n\nWhen he said he was she barely remember him, especially since he had changed so much. Then he told her that he had always had a crush on her. He said she looked beautiful and he immediately took a selfie of them, with his arm tight around her waist. This made her feel a bit strange. She smiled at him and pretended to be happy to see him. But in fact, she wasn't sure how to react though he seems nice.    \n\n\nShe finally excused herself and went to the lady\u2019s room. She was beginning to regret having come to the reunion. She had always been shy, and she still was.    \n\n\nWhen she returned to the party Sharon invited her to sit at her table. Dinner was going to be served soon. And some of the classmates were going to give speeches. Sharon asked Jessica to say a few words too, because people were curious. This was a surprise. Jessica had never been very popular, and she didn't think anyone had noticed her. She had always felt like an outsider with only a couple of close friends. Still she had been one of the best students and people remembered her.    \n\n\nAs the evening wore on, Jessica began to really enjoy herself. She talked with her old friends and was amazed by how some others had changed. For example, Tom used to be good looking and athletic. He was one of the most popular students and a star basketball player. His one problem was math. He had had a hard time in math, especially in geometry. This was because he wasn't a logical thinker. Except for basketball. He didn't want to do anything unless it was easy.    \n\n\nTom was no longer good looking. His nose which had always been large, had grown even larger. He had also gained a lot of weight. His wife had left him, so for the first time ever, he was alone. He looks lonely and depressed, not at all like he used to be.    \n\n\nSteve was a nobody in middle school. People hardly noticed him. He was small, quiet, and a bit ugly with crooked teeth. What he was good at was English. His English was even better than their teachers. After graduating he went to a low ranked University and eventually dropped out. For a while, he worked as a tour guide. 10 years ago, he and some friends started a little company which is now a great success. In fact, he had become a rich, generous man. He had a nice, warm smile and his success hadn\u2019t gone to his head. It was a pleasure to be around him.    \n\n\nBetty used to be the most beautiful girl in school. She wasn't very smart but she was a great singer. She made a video of her singing and it went viral. She became famous overnight but it only lasted for about two years. After that her fans lost interest in her. She tried to become an actress, but she failed. She had been too stiff and nervous in front of the camera.    \n\n\nBetty had a nice husband who seemed to adore her. The one tragedy in her life happened about five years ago. When she lost her daughter to a rare form of cancer. Because it her hair had begun to turn gray. Jessica couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Who had such high hopes in tremendous energy is a girl, but things didn't work out.    \n\n\nAnd then there was John. John used to be the school bully, strong and mean. He hadn't been nice to anybody. It seems that he was always angry and ready to hit someone. After graduating he joined the army and went overseas to fight in a war. He saw many people died and he grew to hate fighting of any kind. Then one day he was nearly killed. When the helicopter he was in was shot down. He survived the crash, but he lost a leg and was hospitalized for nearly a year.    \n\n\nNow he had completely changed. He had gentle kind eyes and a beautiful smile. He was working for an organization that provides support for elderly people. From jessica's point of view John had turned out to be a wonderful surprise.    \n\n\nIn the end, Jessica was glad she went to her reunion. it was interesting to see how people had changed through the years. Still, she was happy to get home and appreciate everything that she had.    \n\n\nVocabulary\n\n\nLanguage of love\n\n\nA broken heart\n is what happens when a love relationship is broken off. Someone with a broken heart is usually depressed which means they feel awful and don't enjoy life. If someone you love breaks off the relationship, it feels like the end of the world. \n\n\nTo fall in love with someone\n can be a wonderful experience with powerful emotions. People in love often share their deepest feelings and emotions which is intimacy. The emotions of love having inspired poets throughout history. \n\n\nPhysically attractive people attract people of the opposite or same sex depending on their sexual orientation. \n\nTo flirt with someone\n means to let him or her know that you want to be approached. Some people use their eyes or a smile to flirt.  \n\nIf someone is flirting with you, they are coming on to you, you may reject their advance or excepted and begin a relationship.   \n\n\nJealousy\n is what often happens when two people compete for the love of the same person. The one who loses may be very jealous of the other and try to break things up. A jealous person often wants to possess the person they love.    \n\n\nReactions to news\n\n\nWhen you are \ncalm\n you can think clearly and make good decisions. Some people are easily \nupset\n and have a hard time controlling their emotions. \nPeople react to disappointing news in different ways. Sometimes they get \ndiscouraged\n and lose their confidence. Sometimes they get \ndepressed\n and begin to cry or even get drunk. \n\n\nDisappointed become think clearly and act constructively.   \n\n\nPeople are \nfurious\n when they are extremely angry. People who are furious at each other may end up fighting or trying to hurt each other. When people are furious at each other they often yell and insult each other.    \n\n\nTo be \nexcited\n is usually a good thing. People can become excited while watching a soccer match and seeing their team score a goal. The opposite of exciting is dull or boring.  \n\n\nSomeone is \nterrified\n if they are extremely afraid and shaking with fear. Terrify people will often scream and run away from whatever is threatening them.     \n\n\nDialogue\n\n\nOffice gossip\n\n\nA:\n What are you so excited about?  \n\n\nB:\n Have you heard? John and Sylvia are getting a divorce   \n\n\nA:\n No, I haven\u2019t. But I am not surprised.  \n\nTo be honest, I never expected their marriage to last very long. She's so aggressive and bossy.  \n\n\nB:\n Well I think John had an affair. He met someone on a business trip.     \n\n\nA:\n Really? How did you find that out?   \n\n\nB:\n Sherry told me a few minutes ago.   \n\n\nA:\n Oh Sherry. She is such a gossip. I wouldn't believe anything she says.   \n\n\nB:\n No, really. This time I think we can trust her. I don't think she's making it up.   \n\n\nA:\n Wow this is news. What about their baby?  \n\n\nB:\n I don't know. I haven't heard anything about that.   \n\n\nA:\n Well that's too bad. Even though I don't like either one of them, I feel sorry for them.   \n\nIt's so sad when this happens, especially for the child.   \n\n\nB:\n Yeah right. It's easy to get caught up in all the gossip and forget to think about the serious consequences.     \n\n\nA:\n Still I can\u2019t same surprised. Can you imagine living with someone like that?   \n\n\nB:\n No, I can't. She is so self-centered.   \n\n\nA:\n And what about him.   \n\n\nB:\n I don't know him well, but he seems nice.   \n\n\nA:\n I think so too. I'm not sure how he ever fell for her.  \n\n\nB:\n Are you kidding? Hormones. You have to admit that she's physically attractive.   \n\nHe probably couldn't help himself. And now it seems he has fallen for someone else.     \n\n\nI guess he can\u2019t control himself.   \n\n\nA:\n I\u2019ve heard he has a drink problem. Too.  \n\n\nB:\n Oh, I wasn't aware of that.   \n\nWell what's new right. Some things never change.   \n\n\nA:\n That's for sure. Hey, what about lunch.   \n\n\nB:\n No thanks. I\u2019d better get back to work.",

And felt a bit awkward and out of place. But it wasn't long before a strange man came up to her. He was already losing his hair and he was wearing thick glasses. \u201cdon't you remember me ? \u201d he asked.      When he said he was she barely remember him, especially since he had changed so much. Then he told her that he had always had a crush on her. He said she looked beautiful and he immediately took a selfie of them, with his arm tight around her waist. This made her feel a bit strange. She smiled at him and pretended to be happy to see him. But in fact, she wasn't sure how to react though he seems nice.      She finally excused herself and went to the lady\u2019s room. She was beginning to regret having come to the reunion. She had always been shy, and she still was.      When she returned to the party Sharon invited her to sit at her table. Dinner was going to be served soon. And some of the classmates were going to give speeches. Sharon asked Jessica to say a few words too, because people were curious. This was a surprise. Jessica had never been very popular, and she didn't think anyone had noticed her. She had always felt like an outsider with only a couple of close friends. Still she had been one of the best students and people remembered her.      As the evening wore on, Jessica began to really enjoy herself. She talked with her old friends and was amazed by how some others had changed. For example, Tom used to be good looking and athletic. He was one of the most popular students and a star basketball player. His one problem was math. He had had a hard time in math, especially in geometry. This was because he wasn't a logical thinker. Except for basketball. He didn't want to do anything unless it was easy.      Tom was no longer good looking. His nose which had always been large, had grown even larger. He had also gained a lot of weight. His wife had left him, so for the first time ever, he was alone. He looks lonely and depressed, not at all like he used to be.      Steve was a nobody in middle school. People hardly noticed him. He was small, quiet, and a bit ugly with crooked teeth. What he was good at was English. His English was even better than their teachers. After graduating he went to a low ranked University and eventually dropped out. For a while, he worked as a tour guide. 10 years ago, he and some friends started a little company which is now a great success. In fact, he had become a rich, generous man. He had a nice, warm smile and his success hadn\u2019t gone to his head. It was a pleasure to be around him.      Betty used to be the most beautiful girl in school. She wasn't very smart but she was a great singer. She made a video of her singing and it went viral. She became famous overnight but it only lasted for about two years. After that her fans lost interest in her. She tried to become an actress, but she failed. She had been too stiff and nervous in front of the camera.      Betty had a nice husband who seemed to adore her. The one tragedy in her life happened about five years ago. When she lost her daughter to a rare form of cancer. Because it her hair had begun to turn gray. Jessica couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Who had such high hopes in tremendous energy is a girl, but things didn't work out.      And then there was John. John used to be the school bully, strong and mean. He hadn't been nice to anybody. It seems that he was always angry and ready to hit someone. After graduating he joined the army and went overseas to fight in a war. He saw many people died and he grew to hate fighting of any kind. Then one day he was nearly killed. When the helicopter he was in was shot down. He survived the crash, but he lost a leg and was hospitalized for nearly a year.      Now he had completely changed. He had gentle kind eyes and a beautiful smile. He was working for an organization that provides support for elderly people. From jessica's point of view John had turned out to be a wonderful surprise.      In the end, Jessica was glad she went to her reunion. it was interesting to see how people had changed through the years. Still, she was happy to get home and appreciate everything that she had.",

            "text": "Level 5 Unit 1 Part 4\n\n\nListening\n\n\nMysteries of nature\n\n\nThere are many mysteries in nature. Mysteries are things we don't understand such as how the Egyptian pyramids were built. In fact, we are surrounded by mysteries. What we know about the world seems like very little.   \n\nScientists tell us that what we see in the universe is only a small part of what is there.  \n\nThe rest is invisible including dark matter and dark energy.   \n\nThese two unknowns make up around 95% of the universe.   \n\nEvidence for their existence comes from their effects on what we can observe, such as the motion and positions of distant galaxies.   \n\nYet though we know very little, we are able to build airplanes and communicate with smartphones. In some ways we humans are very smart or at least we think we are. We still need to face big issues like climate change, and that is going to be a huge challenge. The challenge for humans will be our ability to adapt to a changing environment.   \n\nWhat about other forms of life? How do they adapt? Seasonal variations, for example, can be one of the greatest challenges for animals to overcome. Overcoming such challenges is a great achievement but hardly easy. Some birds migrate thousands of kilometers each year to deal with seasonal changes. These migrations are amazing.   \n\nBirds don't carry maps or compasses, yet they know where to go. They have developed the ability to see the earth's magnetic field. This ability is a wonder of nature. It takes advantage of the fact that the earth is like a huge bar magnet. It has a North Pole which is positive, and a South pole which is negative. Somehow the birds are able to see this magnetic field and use it to their advantage.   \n\nAnd even the way birds fly together is amazing. Many migrating birds flying of the formation.   \n\nThey do this to conserve energy. In a V formation birds can use the energy of the birds in front of them. This energy comes from the air currents generated by the wings. Conserving energy is necessary for the birds to survive the long journey. How did the birds know this? It's truly amazing how the birds know this.     \n\n\nAnother amazing example of survival is the salmon.   \n\nSalmon spend most of their lives in the ocean, which is saltwater.   \n\nYet, when it's time to breed, they do so in freshwater rivers.   \n\nSalmon can adapt their bodies to survive in both saltwater and freshwater.  \n\nWhen its breeding time they return to the same River where they were born. It seems as if they had a built-in map that guides them for hundreds of miles.     \n\n\nOnce they leave the saltwater they don't eat. They are determined to finish their journey despite the many obstacles. They swim against strong currents, jump over waterfalls, and try to escape the claws of hungry bears. Many die along the way but enough of them survive to breed and produce the next generation. Once they have laid their eggs they die having completed their journey. It seems that their purpose in life is just to reproduce.     \n\n\nMigration takes animals to new, more favorable environments when the seasons change. some of these journeys are long and dangerous, along routes with no obvious landmarks. the longest migration is that of the Arctic tern. it flies from pole to pole twice a year. if a tern flies its average lifespan of 20 years the distance, it has flown will be equivalent to a journey to the moon and back.    \n\n\nHumans also migrate but seldom if ever for seasonal variations. Unfortunately, human migrations are often due to human activities. Since the beginning of the 21st century, large scale migrations have become a global problem. Millions of migrants have had to leave their countries and look for new homes. Many have died along the way or left as refugees in camps until they are admitted into a new country. So the question remains as to how our global community will face these challenges.    \n\n\nVocabulary\n\n\nSocial relations\n\n\nTo \ncriticize\n someone is to point out their faults or mistakes. Some people appreciate constructive criticism which can help them develop their skills. Some people cannot take any criticism without feeling hurt.     \n\n\nTo \npraise\n someone is to let them know that they have done a good job. Some people expect to be praised when they have performed well. Knowing when and how to praise someone is an important skill.     \n\n\nTo \napologize\n to someone is to admit that you have done something wrong or hurtful. One way to apologize is to say you are sorry. If your apology isn't accepted it means the person hasn't forgiven you. If you accidentally hurt someone it's usually a good idea to apologize.     \n\n\nTo \norder\n people to do something means to use your power or position to get them to do it. Many people dislike being ordered to do things. In many cases it's better to make a request in order someone to do something.  A boss may order his employees to do something and they will usually agree to do it, even if they don't want to.     \n\n\nTo \nencourage\n someone is to support their efforts and help build their confidence. A good teacher encourages students to do their best. To discourage someone is to take away their confidence. Some people are discouraged if they don't receive praise or recognition for their work.     \n\n\nScience vocabulary\n\n\nThere are many different \ncycles\n in nature such as the cycle of seasons. A cycle is a series of events that repeat such as the daily cycle of light and dark. The time it takes for a cycle to repeat itself is its period.   \n\nTo \nevolve\n means to change or improve over a period of time. In biology, the theory of evolution says that advanced life forms, such as humans have evolved from lower forms of life. Life forms involved because they have to adapt in order to survive.   \n\nA \nforce\n of Attraction brings two objects closer together, such as the force of gravity. A force of pulsion pushes two objects away from each other, such as the force between two electrons.   \n\n\nGravity\n is a force of attraction between two objects with mass.   \n\nTo \ntransform\n needs to change from one form into another. A transformation occurs when an object takes on a new appearance or structure. Over a period of time the process of evolution can transform the appearance of a species of life.   \n\nTo \nInherit\n something needs to get it without having to ask or work for it. A child from a very rich family may inherit a lot of money. Eye and hair color are inherited traits.     \n\n\nDialogue\n\n\nHandling office conflicts\n\n\nEmployee W:\n Excuse me, do you have a minute?   \n\n\nBoss:\n I'm sorry, not right now. I'll be free in about 15 minutes. Could you come back then?   \n\nTo be free is the opposite of busy.  \n\n\nEmployee W:\n No, I'm afraid we have an emergency upstairs.   \n\n\nBoss:\n Can\u2019t you handle it?   \n\n\nEmployee W:\n No, I think it would be best if you were there.   \n\n\nBoss:\n OK. I\u2019ll finish this call and be right with you.  \n\n\nBoss:\n OK. what is it?   \n\n\nEmployee W:\n Kevin and bob are shouting at each other and it's upsetting everyone.  \n\nTo upset everyone means to make them feel uncomfortable.   \n\n\nBoss:\n Oh. Not again. Both must have gotten to grow up. Who started it?   \n\n\nEmployee W:\n I'm not sure. But they were even pushing each other.   \n\n\nBoss:\n OK. This is unacceptable. You run on ahead and warn them that I'm coming. I want them to calm down before I get there. Can you do that?   \n\n\nEmployee W:\n OK. I will do what I can to calm them down. But you know Kevin, he's such a hot head.   \n\nTo calm down is the opposite of to get upset.  \n\nThis isn't the first time they've had problems.   \n\n\nBoss:\n OK. Kevin i've warned you before. This is gotta stop.   \n\n\nKevin:\n yes, I know. But bob doesn't cooperate. He's impossible to work with.   \n\n\nBoss:\n even so you can't go around pushing people. That's no way to handle things. If you were doing such a good job I have to let you go right now. Your behavior just isn't acceptable.  \n\nIn this case to let him go means to fire him.  \n\n\nKevin:\n yeah. I understand and I'm sorry. I just can't stand working with him.   \n\n\nBoss:\n I'm not sure what to do. What would you do if you were me. Do you have any suggestions?   \n\n\nKevin:\n to be honest, if I were you I wouldn't have the two of us work in the same office. I know bob has been with the company longer than I have, but he's doing a terrible job. When you are not around, he just bullies people. People are afraid of him.   \n\n\nBoss:\n OK I\u2019ll look into it a bit more. But you got to (gotta) promise me to keep cool and not let this happen again.   \n\n\nKevin:\n OK I\u2019ll try to handle things differently next time.",

            "text": "There are many mysteries in nature. Mysteries are things we don't understand such as how the Egyptian pyramids were built. In fact, we are surrounded by mysteries. What we know about the world seems like very little.    \nScientists tell us that what we see in the universe is only a small part of what is there.   \nThe rest is invisible including dark matter and dark energy.    \nThese two unknowns make up around 95% of the universe.    \nEvidence for their existence comes from their effects on what we can observe, such as the motion and positions of distant galaxies.    \nYet though we know very little, we are able to build airplanes and communicate with smartphones. In some ways we humans are very smart or at least we think we are. We still need to face big issues like climate change, and that is going to be a huge challenge. The challenge for humans will be our ability to adapt to a changing environment.    \nWhat about other forms of life? How do they adapt? Seasonal variations, for example, can be one of the greatest challenges for animals to overcome. Overcoming such challenges is a great achievement but hardly easy. Some birds migrate thousands of kilometers each year to deal with seasonal changes. These migrations are amazing.    \nBirds don't carry maps or compasses, yet they know where to go. They have developed the ability to see the earth's magnetic field. This ability is a wonder of nature. It takes advantage of the fact that the earth is like a huge bar magnet. It has a North Pole which is positive, and a South pole which is negative. Somehow the birds are able to see this magnetic field and use it to their advantage.    \nAnd even the way birds fly together is amazing. Many migrating birds flying of the formation.    \nThey do this to conserve energy. In a V formation birds can use the energy of the birds in front of them. This energy comes from the air currents generated by the wings. Conserving energy is necessary for the birds to survive the long journey. How did the birds know this? It's truly amazing how the birds know this.       Another amazing example of survival is the salmon.    \nSalmon spend most of their lives in the ocean, which is saltwater.    \nYet, when it's time to breed, they do so in freshwater rivers.    \nSalmon can adapt their bodies to survive in both saltwater and freshwater.   \nWhen its breeding time they return to the same River where they were born.

However, there are many\ndifferent kinds of love. \nRomantic love is certainly one of the most interesting\nkinds of love.\n It can be beautiful wonderful and heartbreaking sometimes all at\nthe same time. \nRomantic love can make our lives full and meaningful, but it can\nalso be an escape from loneliness and suffering.\n\n\nOther kinds of love include the love between a parent and child.\n\n\nIf romantic love has a purpose, neither psychology nor biology has discovered\nit.\n \nHowever\n, throughout \nhistory\n philosophers have offered \nopinions\n about\nit. The Greek philosopher Plato said love makes us complete. He relates a comic\nstory in which humans originally had 4 arms 4 legs and 2 faces\n. Then when they\nangered the gods they were cut in half\n. \nSince then every person has been\nsearching for their soul mate, the other half of his or herself.\n\n\nAnother philosopher believe that love is an illusion\n. In his view, people\nfall in love because they believe the other person can make them happy. But in\nfact, this is just an illusion designed to make us have children. \nOnce we have\nchildren we are right back to where we were still searching for happiness.\n\nFurniture this is a success because we have children to maintain our species,\nbut it leaves us still searching for something more.\n\n\nIf something is an illusion it isn't what it seems to be.\n\n\nIn Buddhism, romantic love is seen as an attempt to satisfy our desires. These\ndesires are a defect something we need to overcome. The way to free ourselves\nfrom suffering is to remove desires. \nOnce free of desires we can reach a state\nof peace and wisdom\n. This state of being is called nirvana.\n\n\nIn one of china's greatest classical novels dream of the red chamber love is\npresented as a state of foolishness. \nA young man falls in love with a beautiful\nwoman who tricks and makes a full of him.\n This results in conflicting emotions\nof love and hate which tear him apart. \nTo cure him, a priest gives him a magic\nmirror.\n The priest tells him to look into the reverse side of the mirror but\nnever to look in the front side.\n\n\nWhen the young man looks into the mirror he doesn't like what he sees. So he\nlooks into the forbidden side, the front side. There he sees the lovely image of\nhis love who invites him into the mirror to be with her. He does this several\ntimes until he is finally dragged away in chains. He dies while looking into the\nmirror. \nPerhaps the point of the story is that all such attachments should be\navoided.\n\n\nA famous French writer Simona de Beauvoir has another point of view. \nFor her, love is the desire to integrate with another, like in a great friendship\n.\nHowever, it is important that lovers not become too dependent on the other person. Becoming dependent on another person can lead to boredom or power games.\n\nLovers should support each other in discovering themselves and developing their potentials.\n \nIn this way romantic love can enrich the world. Falling in love can be exciting and frightening. Maybe we lose ourselves and maybe we find ourselves.\n Will you dare to find out?\n\n\nVocabulary\n\n\nDescribing situations\n\n\nForbidden or prohibited\n, to be against the rules or not allowed.\n\nSmoking is prohibited on many airplanes.\n\nAthletes are forbidden from taking certain kinds of drugs\n. If something is allowed it isn't forbidden or prohibited.\n\nTourists are \nforbidden\n from taking pictures \ninside\n the museum.\n\n\nRisky\n, to be a bit dangerous or unsafe.\n\nA risky investment may not be a good idea for people who worry too much.\n\nIf you \nmake\n a \nrisky\n investment you may \nlose\n a lot of money.\n\nWhat level of risk are you willing to take?\n\nStarting a new company can be very \nrisky\n because most new companies \nfail\n within 5 years.\n\n\nRidiculous\n, to be foolish or not make any sense.\n\nTheir proposal is ridiculous because it requires too much time and money.\n\nWithout enough quality practice it's ridiculous to expect much progress.\n\nIt's \nridiculous\n for us to expect great \nresults\n from such a \npoorly\n designed product.\n\n\nInnovative\n, to come up with a new idea or way of doing things.\n\nInnovative people are usually clever and creative.\n\nIt means to come up with a new way of doing something. Innovative thinking can lead to the development of new products and services.\n\nIf they want to be \ninnovative\n they should \nchange\n the way they been \ndoing\n things.\n\n\nConservative\n, if to be conservative is to avoid taking risks.\n\nConservative investors try to make safe investments.\n\nConservative investor wants to minimize risks. A conservative approach to management may discourage innovation.\n\nHer parents are very \nconservative,\n so they don't \napprove\n of her wearing so much makeup.\n\n\nInteracting with others\n\n\nTo disguise\n, to change some things appearance so that it can't be\nrecognized.\n\nHe wasn't good at \ndisguising\n himself, so we \nknew who\n he was right away.\n\n\nShe wore a disguise, so I wasn't sure who she was.\n\nShe \ndisguised\n her true intentions, so nobody \nknew\n what she was \nplanning\n to do.\n\n\nTo clarify\n, to explain or make something clear.\n\nWe weren't sure what he meant until he clarified his ideas.\n\nEveryone was confused until she clarified what she meant.\n\nWe can't agree to your proposal unless you \nclarify\n a few points.\n\n\nTo confuse\n, to make things difficult to understand, the opposite of to clarify\n.\n\n\nEveryone was confused because her presentation was so disorganized.\n\nHe confuses people because he keeps changing his ideas.\n\nThe instructions were confusing, so nobody knew what to do.\n\nA good leader can make \ndecisions\n even when the situation is \nconfusing\n.\n\n\nTo ignore\n, to try not to notice or deal with something to act as if\nsomething isn't there.\n\nWe tried to ignore her, but she finally stood up and told everyone to shut up.\n\n\nPeople don't respect or like her, so they ignore her in the office.\n\n\nHe is an ignorant old fool, so we should just ignore him.\n\n\nTo confirm,\n to indicate that something is correct or completed as\nexpected\n.\n\n\nWe weren't sure if he was going to accept our offer until he called and\nconfirmed it.\n\nWe can't start the project without written confirmation that we agree on the details.\n\nWe can\u2019t afford to make a \nmistake\n, so we need to \nconfirm\n the \nfacts\n.\n\n\nDialogue\n\n\nThe teenage years\n\n\nA:\n What's so funny? What are you writing about?\n\n\nB: I\u2019m writing about something I saw earlier this morning.\n\n\nA:\n Really? Do you keep a journal?\n\n\nB:\n Yes, I do. Every weekend I write about things that happens during the week.\n\n\nA:\n How long have you been doing it?\n\n\nB:\n I\u2019ve \nbeen\n doing it \nfairly\n regularly \nsince\n high school.\n\n\nA:\n Are you going to turn it into a book?\n\n\nB:\n I don't know maybe I will someday but for now it's just for me.\n\n\nA:\n So, what was so interesting about what you saw this morning?\n\n\nB:\n I was in the same coffee shop I usually go to and a group of teenagers\ncame in. \nI couldn't help watching them\n and trying to hear some of their conversation.\n\n\nA: That must have been interesting.\n\n\nB:\n Yes, it was. The more I watch them the more I realize how glad I am that I don't have to go through that stage of life again.\n\n\nA:\n So, it brought back some memories.\n\n\nB:\n Yes, it did. It was so \nclear\n how uncomfortable some of them \nwere\n, \nyet\n they were pretending \nto have\n a good time. At least that's how it seems to me.\n\n\nA: Why do you think they were pretending?\n\n\nB:\n It was just the way they smiled and laughed. It seemed unnatural and over done as if they were bad actors.\n\n\nA couple of the boys were really awkward around the girls and 2 of the girls were wearing too much makeup. I had to stop myself laughing.\n\n\nA:\n Yes, I can imagine it. \nI can remember wanting to be popular when I was in high school\n. Now that you mention it. It wasn't a great time, though I had some fun too.\n\n\nB:\n I guess it wasn't so bad at the time, except when I was preparing for my university entrance examinations.\n\n\nA:\n Yes, that was awful. \nMy parents put tons of pressure on me, so I thought I was going to go crazy.\n\n\nWhat about girls, did you have any girlfriends?\n\n\nB:\n \nThere was one girl I had a crush on, but I thought she was interested in somebody else.\n \nI didn't find out until much later that she was interested in me too.\n It was a lost opportunity, one of many.\n\n\nA:\n Really? You should become a writer or make a movie. You have a great imagination.\n\n\nB:\n To be honest, it's much easier to imagine things than actually do things.\n\n\nA:\n You can say that again.",

When the young man looks into the mirror he doesn't like what he sees. So he\nlooks into the forbidden side, the front side. There he sees the lovely image of\nhis love who invites him into the mirror to be with her. He does this several\ntimes until he is finally dragged away in chains. He dies while looking into the\nmirror.  Perhaps the point of the story is that all such attachments should be\navoided.  A famous French writer Simona de Beauvoir has another point of view.  For her, love is the desire to integrate with another, like in a great friendship .\nHowever, it is important that lovers not become too dependent on the other person. Becoming dependent on another person can lead to boredom or power games. Lovers should support each other in discovering themselves and developing their potentials.   In this way romantic love can enrich the world. Falling in love can be exciting and frightening. Maybe we lose ourselves and maybe we find ourselves.  Will you dare to find out?",

A:  Are you going to turn it into a book?  B:  I don't know maybe I will someday but for now it's just for me.  A:  So, what was so interesting about what you saw this morning?  B:  I was in the same coffee shop I usually go to and a group of teenagers\ncame in.  I couldn't help watching them  and trying to hear some of their conversation.  A: That must have been interesting.  B:  Yes, it was. The more I watch them the more I realize how glad I am that I don't have to go through that stage of life again.  A:  So, it brought back some memories.  B:  Yes, it did. It was so  clear  how uncomfortable some of them  were ,  yet  they were pretending  to have  a good time. At least that's how it seems to me.  A: Why do you think they were pretending?  B:  It was just the way they smiled and laughed. It seemed unnatural and over done as if they were bad actors.  A couple of the boys were really awkward around the girls and 2 of the girls were wearing too much makeup. I had to stop myself laughing.  A:  Yes, I can imagine it.  I can remember wanting to be popular when I was in high school . Now that you mention it. It wasn't a great time, though I had some fun too.  B:  I guess it wasn't so bad at the time, except when I was preparing for my university entrance examinations.  A:  Yes, that was awful.  My parents put tons of pressure on me, so I thought I was going to go crazy.  What about girls, did you have any girlfriends?  B:   There was one girl I had a crush on, but I thought she was interested in somebody else.   I didn't find out until much later that she was interested in me too.  It was a lost opportunity, one of many.  A:  Really? You should become a writer or make a movie. You have a great imagination.

We will call him ice man because his body was frozen in ice for several 1000 years. His body was discovered in 1991 by 2 hikers in the mountains near the border of Austria and Italy. The lower part of his body was still frozen in ice, but \nthe upper part was uncovered invisible\n.\n\n\nOnce the body was extracted from the ice it was taken in for examination.\n\n\nUpon examination scientist determined that the ice man left around 5,300 years ago.\n\n\nThis was at the end of the stone age, nearly 1000 years before the great\npyramids were built.

            "text": "Level 5 Unit 2 Part 4\n\n\nListening\n\n\nWorld\u2019s oldest murder\n\n\nWhen the body of the iceman was discovered, nobody realized that he had been murdered.\n It was first believed that he got lost in the storm and had died in the cold weather.\n\n\nHowever, with the discovery of an arrowhead in his body, it was clear that the iceman was murdered.\n\n\nAnalysis showed that the arrow had entered his body and cut through an artery in his chest.\n\n\nThis could have caused severe bleeding and weakened him.\n\n\nWith the loss of blood, he couldn't have survived for very long after being shot.\n\n\nFurther examination is revealed something more about how he may have died. Using a CT scan, scientists found blood in his brain. This indicated that he was \nstruck\n on the head before he died. \nEither he was hit on the head or he fell and struck his head on a rock\n. This probably \nhappened\n when he was in a weakened \ncondition\n after being \nshot\n by the arrow.\n\n\nAdditional evidence showed that the arrow itself had been pulled out of the body.\n\n\nIt had been pulled out with force leaving just the arrowhead inside.\n\n\nEven more interesting was what was left behind, the copper ax.\n\n\nThe technology needed to make such a weapon was new at the time.\n\n\nAs a result, scientists believe it was a sign of great wealth and position. This\nsuggests that the iceman may have been an important leader\n. It also raises the\nquestion of why the killer didn't take it with him.\n\n\nIf the iceman was important, he may have been the leader of his community. One leading theory about his death is that he was assassinated. In ancient times, to take power, you often had to kill the leader. \nPerhaps the iceman was the target of an assassination\n. The murderer may have \nfollowed\n the iceman and \nkilled\n him from behind. Then, to \nprotect\n his identity, he pulled out the arrow and\n\ncovered\n the body. \nHe left the copper ax behind so that he couldn't be identified.\n According to this theory, \nthe iceman was killed by a member of his own community\n. Therefore, the murderer was probably someone he knew.\n\n\nAnother theory is that the ice man was killed after a battle with outsiders.\nSince this community is located along an important trade route, it may have been attacked. \nThe iceman may have been a military leader fighting to defend his village. Perhaps he was in a battle with the attackers on the day that he died.\n According to this theory he was fleeing from the battle and was caught from behind in an isolated area.\n\n\nHowever, from an analysis of his stomach, it is unlikely that he was running from anyone. There was a half-pound of food in his stomach when he died. \nSince food only remains in the stomach for about an hour, he must have eaten a large meal shortly before his death.\n Someone who is in a hurry would never take the time to stop and eat such a large meal. And if he was killed by outsiders, why didn't they take the copper axe. So the question remains about what happened on that final day of his life. The truth is that nobody will ever know what really happened. The iceman's murder will remain a mystery forever.\n\n\nVocabulary\n\n\nInteractions\n\n\nTo interfere, to slow something down or make worse by getting in the way.\n\n\nHaving too many meetings is interfering with our work.\n\nI told her to \nleave\n us alone and not to \ninterfere\n in our  \nproblems\n.\n\nShe told me not \nto interfere,\n so I left the room and let them \ndeal\n with the problem.\n\n\nTo reflect, to think about or consider something or to throw back in image as from a mirror.\n\n\nBefore I make a decision, I\u2019d like some time to reflect.\n\n\nWhen you look into a mirror your image is reflected back to you.\n\n\nUpon further \nreflection\n, I decided to \npostpone\n the project.\n\n\nTo influence, to have an effect on something.\n\nI think she can help us influence the others.\n\nI don't think we can influence the final result.\n\nThey don't \ncare\n what we \nthink\n, so it will be difficult to \ninfluence\n their decision.\n\nWe can't \ninfluence\n the \nresult\n, so we don't need to \nworry\n about it.\n\n\nWith his powerful support, maybe we can influence their decision to postpone the project.\n\n\nTo focus, to bring attention to something and make it clear.\n\nIf we don't focus on something, we won't get anything done.\n\n\nWe aren't sure what to focus on, so everyone is confused.\n\nThe problem with that company is \nthat\n they don't \nfocus\n enough on \nimproving\n\nquality.\n\n\nTo exaggerate\n, to describe something is larger or more important than it really is.\n\nIt's difficult to believe what he says, because he always exaggerates.\n\nShe said she could \nsell\n anything but of course \nthat\n was an  \nexaggeration\n.\n\nIn my \nopinion\n it's better \nto exaggerate\n your skills a bit in an interview \nrather\n than be too modest.\n\n\nFeatures of information\n\n\nTo be persuasive\n, able to cause people to do something by asking or giving\nreasons.\n\n\nShe's good at selling things because she is very persuasive\n.\n\n\nYou can be more persuasive if you have facts to support you.\n\nThey can't be \npersuaded\n to change their minds so let's not \nwaste\n time with them.\n\n\nTo be convincing,\n to provide powerful support for belief and to overcome doubts.\n\n\nThe evidence that he was murdered was convincing.\n\nI couldn't convince them that I was telling the truth, so they arrested me.\n\nShe was \nconvinced\n that we had the best product, \nbut\n she couldn't be\n\npersuaded\n to buy.\n\n\nTo be misleading, to lead away from the truth to give a false idea.\n\nThey are advertisements are misleading, so be careful not to be fooled.\n\nShe tried to \nmislead\n me into \nbuying\n it by \nexaggerating\n the benefits.\n\n\nI was really disappointed when the product arrived because the advertisement\nwas misleading.\n\n\nHe exaggerated the facts, so his presentation was misleading and ineffective.\n\n\nTo be unique, to be highly unusual or different from others.\n\n\nI like that design because it's unique and attractive.\n\n\nShe has a unique personality that some people don't like.\n\nI love to listen to him \nsing\n, because he has a very \nunique voice\n.\n\n\nTo be ordinary, to be just like others not different from any other.\n\nTheir products are \nordinary,\n with nothing \nexcept\n a low price to \nrecommend\n them.\n\nThe food at that restaurant was expensive but the taste was ordinary.\n\nThey're looking for engineers who are \ncreative\n and can go beyond the\n\nordinary\n.\n\n\nDialogue\n\n\nImproving personal image\n\n\nM:\n Did you see the beautiful sunset tonight?

It would improve your image.\n\n\nM:\n So, you think my image needs improving.\n\n\nW:\n Well, it wouldn't hurt to be a little less formal and to smile once in a while. \nYou might also improve the way you dress, maybe with a few more warm colors.\n\n\nM:\n \nI\u2019m afraid I don't know much about fashion design and warm colors.\n Do you really think the way we dress influences people?\n\n\nW:\n You must be kidding. \nThe first impression you give is based on your\nappearance and clothes. Don't you ever notice the kind of shoes someone is wearing?\n\n\nW:\n Well then that explains why you were wearing such shoes always the same.\n\n\nM: No, I hardly notice.\n\n\nW:\n How old are the shoes you're wearing now?\n\n\nM:\n These? I don't know probably a year old.\n\n\nW:\n And I bet you been wearing them almost every day. They look like it.\n\n\nM:\n That's right, these shoes are comfortable, and they weren't expensive. I bet yours were expensive.\n\n\nW:\n Well they were cheap\n. I think it's important to dress right. To dress for the occasion and make a good impression.\n\n\nM:\n Ok, why don't we go shopping together this weekend? You can be my fashion\nadvisor.\n\n\nW:\n Was it in for me?\n\n\nM:\n If I like your advice, I\u2019ll buy you another pair of shoes. How's that?\n\n\nW:\n Ok. But they won't be cheap. You understand that, right?\n\n\nM:\n Of course. But it'll be worth it if you think my new look will improve my image.\n\n\nW:\n I guarantee it. \nWith me as an advisor you can't go wrong.",

            "text": "When the body of the iceman was discovered, nobody realized that he had been murdered.  It was first believed that he got lost in the storm and had died in the cold weather.  However, with the discovery of an arrowhead in his body, it was clear that the iceman was murdered.  Analysis showed that the arrow had entered his body and cut through an artery in his chest.  This could have caused severe bleeding and weakened him.  With the loss of blood, he couldn't have survived for very long after being shot.  Further examination is revealed something more about how he may have died. Using a CT scan, scientists found blood in his brain. This indicated that he was  struck  on the head before he died.  Either he was hit on the head or he fell and struck his head on a rock . This probably  happened  when he was in a weakened  condition  after being  shot  by the arrow.  Additional evidence showed that the arrow itself had been pulled out of the body.  It had been pulled out with force leaving just the arrowhead inside.  Even more interesting was what was left behind, the copper ax.  The technology needed to make such a weapon was new at the time.  As a result, scientists believe it was a sign of great wealth and position. This\nsuggests that the iceman may have been an important leader . It also raises the\nquestion of why the killer didn't take it with him.  If the iceman was important, he may have been the leader of his community. One leading theory about his death is that he was assassinated. In ancient times, to take power, you often had to kill the leader.  Perhaps the iceman was the target of an assassination . The murderer may have  followed  the iceman and  killed  him from behind. Then, to  protect  his identity, he pulled out the arrow and covered  the body.  He left the copper ax behind so that he couldn't be identified.  According to this theory,  the iceman was killed by a member of his own community . Therefore, the murderer was probably someone he knew.  Another theory is that the ice man was killed after a battle with outsiders.\nSince this community is located along an important trade route, it may have been attacked.  The iceman may have been a military leader fighting to defend his village. Perhaps he was in a battle with the attackers on the day that he died.  According to this theory he was fleeing from the battle and was caught from behind in an isolated area.  However, from an analysis of his stomach, it is unlikely that he was running from anyone. There was a half-pound of food in his stomach when he died.  Since food only remains in the stomach for about an hour, he must have eaten a large meal shortly before his death.  Someone who is in a hurry would never take the time to stop and eat such a large meal. And if he was killed by outsiders, why didn't they take the copper axe. So the question remains about what happened on that final day of his life. The truth is that nobody will ever know what really happened. The iceman's murder will remain a mystery forever.",

To exaggerate , to describe something is larger or more important than it really is. \nIt's difficult to believe what he says, because he always exaggerates. \nShe said she could  sell  anything but of course  that  was an   exaggeration . \nIn my  opinion  it's better  to exaggerate  your skills a bit in an interview  rather  than be too modest.",
