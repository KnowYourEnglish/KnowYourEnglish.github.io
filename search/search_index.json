            "text": "Level 5 Unit 1 Part 1\n\n\nListening\n\n\nJessica\u2019s class reunion\n\n\nJessica is 35 years old. She graduated from middle school 20 years ago. This year her middle school class had its 20-year class reunion. All of her classmates and teachers were invited to attend. It was going to be at a hotel near where their school used to be. Like many other buildings the school had been torn down. It had been replaced by some apartment buildings.\n\n\nAt first, she wasn't sure if she could go to the reunion. One reason was that there wasn't anyone in particular that she wanted to see. Another reason was that she was very busy. She was a working mother with a boy 8- years old and a husband who was rarely at home. Going to the reunion meant that she would have to arrange for someone to take care of things while she was away. That wouldn't be easy. She didn't want to take her boy with her, and her husband wouldn't take time off from work.\n\n\nThen she got a message from Sharon, one of her old classmates. Sharon was contacting people from their class and urging everyone to come. In their schooldays, Sharon was class monitor and now she was helping to organize the reunion.\n\n\nNone of them had seen or heard from her since graduation. They were especially curious since she hadn't gone to their first reunion 10 years before.\n\n\nJessica decided to arrange things so that she could go.\n\n\nHer husband finally agreed to take care of things while she was away.\n\n\nHe agreed to do it because her mother had offered to come and stay for a while. So Jessica could attend the reunion.\n\n\nSince he and her mother didn't get along, he decided to change his schedule and work from home for a few days.\n\n\nHe really didn't want her mother to come though he didn't say so.\n\n\nWhen she got to the reunion, she was shocked everyone had aged so much and many were out of shape. Some who used to be good looking had lost their looks completely. And others looked much better than before. It was strange how time had changed people in such different ways. Anyway, she decided that since she was there she would try to enjoy it.\n\n\nVocabulary\n\n\nActions and change\n\n\nTo replace\n something means to put something else in its place when something gets old and begins to breakdown it may need to be replaced.\nIf someone leave the company, the person may need to be replaced by someone else.\n\nTo tear \nsomething down means to break it apart.

            "text": "Jessica is 35 years old. She graduated from middle school 20 years ago. This year her middle school class had its 20-year class reunion. All of her classmates and teachers were invited to attend. It was going to be at a hotel near where their school used to be. Like many other buildings the school had been torn down. It had been replaced by some apartment buildings.  At first, she wasn't sure if she could go to the reunion. One reason was that there wasn't anyone in particular that she wanted to see. Another reason was that she was very busy. She was a working mother with a boy 8- years old and a husband who was rarely at home. Going to the reunion meant that she would have to arrange for someone to take care of things while she was away. That wouldn't be easy. She didn't want to take her boy with her, and her husband wouldn't take time off from work.  Then she got a message from Sharon, one of her old classmates. Sharon was contacting people from their class and urging everyone to come. In their schooldays, Sharon was class monitor and now she was helping to organize the reunion.  None of them had seen or heard from her since graduation. They were especially curious since she hadn't gone to their first reunion 10 years before.  Jessica decided to arrange things so that she could go.  Her husband finally agreed to take care of things while she was away.  He agreed to do it because her mother had offered to come and stay for a while. So Jessica could attend the reunion.  Since he and her mother didn't get along, he decided to change his schedule and work from home for a few days.  He really didn't want her mother to come though he didn't say so.  When she got to the reunion, she was shocked everyone had aged so much and many were out of shape. Some who used to be good looking had lost their looks completely. And others looked much better than before. It was strange how time had changed people in such different ways. Anyway, she decided that since she was there she would try to enjoy it.",

When she arrived, she wasn't sure she was in the right place. At first, she didn't recognize anyone. And felt a bit awkward and out of place. But it wasn't long before a strange man came up to her. He was already losing his hair and he was wearing thick glasses. \u201cdon't you remember me ? \u201d he asked.\n\n\nWhen he said he was she barely remember him, especially since he had changed so much. Then he told her that he had always had a crush on her. He said she looked beautiful and he immediately took a selfie of them, with his arm tight around her waist. This made her feel a bit strange. She smiled at him and pretended to be happy to see him. But in fact, she wasn't sure how to react though he seems nice.\n\n\nShe finally excused herself and went to the lady\u2019s room. She was beginning to regret having come to the reunion. She had always been shy, and she still was.\n\n\nWhen she returned to the party Sharon invited her to sit at her table. Dinner was going to be served soon. And some of the classmates were going to give speeches. Sharon asked Jessica to say a few words too, because people were curious. This was a surprise. Jessica had never been very popular, and she didn't think anyone had noticed her. She had always felt like an outsider with only a couple of close friends. Still she had been one of the best students and people remembered her.\n\n\nAs the evening wore on, Jessica began to really enjoy herself. She talked with her old friends and was amazed by how some others had changed. For example, Tom used to be good looking and athletic. He was one of the most popular students and a star basketball player. His one problem was math. He had had a hard time in math, especially in geometry. This was because he wasn't a logical thinker. Except for basketball. He didn't want to do anything unless it was easy.\n\n\nTom was no longer good looking. His nose which had always been large, had grown even larger. He had also gained a lot of weight. His wife had left him, so for the first time ever, he was alone. He looks lonely and depressed, not at all like he used to be.\n\n\nSteve was a nobody in middle school. People hardly noticed him. He was small, quiet, and a bit ugly with crooked teeth. What he was good at was English. His English was even better than their teachers. After graduating he went to a low ranked University and eventually dropped out. For a while, he worked as a tour guide. 10 years ago, he and some friends started a little company which is now a great success. In fact, he had become a rich, generous man. He had a nice, warm smile and his success hadn\u2019t gone to his head. It was a pleasure to be around him.\n\n\nBetty used to be the most beautiful girl in school. She wasn't very smart but she was a great singer. She made a video of her singing and it went viral. She became famous overnight but it only lasted for about two years. After that her fans lost interest in her. She tried to become an actress, but she failed. She had been too stiff and nervous in front of the camera.\n\n\nBetty had a nice husband who seemed to adore her. The one tragedy in her life happened about five years ago. When she lost her daughter to a rare form of cancer. Because it her hair had begun to turn gray. Jessica couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Who had such high hopes in tremendous energy is a girl, but things didn't work out.\n\n\nAnd then there was John. John used to be the school bully, strong and mean. He hadn't been nice to anybody. It seems that he was always angry and ready to hit someone. After graduating he joined the army and went overseas to fight in a war. He saw many people died and he grew to hate fighting of any kind. Then one day he was nearly killed. When the helicopter he was in was shot down. He survived the crash, but he lost a leg and was hospitalized for nearly a year.\n\n\nNow he had completely changed. He had gentle kind eyes and a beautiful smile. He was working for an organization that provides support for elderly people. From jessica's point of view John had turned out to be a wonderful surprise.\n\n\nIn the end, Jessica was glad she went to her reunion. it was interesting to see how people had changed through the years. Still, she was happy to get home and appreciate everything that she had.",
