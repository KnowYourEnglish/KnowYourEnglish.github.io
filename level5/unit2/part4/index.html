<h3 id="worlds-oldest-murder">World’s oldest murder</h3>
<p><em>When the body of the iceman was discovered, nobody realized that he had been murdered.</em> It was first believed that he got lost in the storm and had died in the cold weather.</p>
<p>However, with the discovery of an arrowhead in his body, it was clear that the iceman was murdered.</p>
<p>Analysis showed that the arrow had entered his body and cut through an artery in his chest.</p>
<p>This could have caused severe bleeding and weakened him.</p>
<p>With the loss of blood, he couldn't have survived for very long after being shot.</p>
<p>Further examination is revealed something more about how he may have died. Using a CT scan, scientists found blood in his brain. This indicated that he was <em>struck</em> on the head before he died. <strong>Either he was hit on the head or he fell and struck his head on a rock</strong>. This probably <em>happened</em> when he was in a weakened <em>condition</em> after being <em>shot</em> by the arrow.</p>
<p>Additional evidence showed that the arrow itself had been pulled out of the body.</p>
<p>It had been pulled out with force leaving just the arrowhead inside.</p>
<p>Even more interesting was what was left behind, the copper ax.</p>
<p>The technology needed to make such a weapon was new at the time.</p>
<p>As a result, scientists believe it was a sign of great wealth and position. This
suggests that the iceman may have been an important leader<strong>. It also raises the
question of why the killer didn't take it with him.</strong></p>
<p>If the iceman was important, he may have been the leader of his community. One leading theory about his death is that he was assassinated. In ancient times, to take power, you often had to kill the leader. <em>Perhaps the iceman was the target of an assassination</em>. The murderer may have <em>followed</em> the iceman and <em>killed</em> him from behind. Then, to <em>protect</em> his identity, he pulled out the arrow and
<em>covered</em> the body. <strong>He left the copper ax behind so that he couldn't be identified.</strong> According to this theory, <em>the iceman was killed by a member of his own community</em>. Therefore, the murderer was probably someone he knew.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the ice man was killed after a battle with outsiders.
Since this community is located along an important trade route, it may have been attacked. <strong>The iceman may have been a military leader fighting to defend his village. Perhaps he was in a battle with the attackers on the day that he died.</strong> According to this theory he was fleeing from the battle and was caught from behind in an isolated area.</p>
<p>However, from an analysis of his stomach, it is unlikely that he was running from anyone. There was a half-pound of food in his stomach when he died. <em>Since food only remains in the stomach for about an hour, he must have eaten a large meal shortly before his death.</em> Someone who is in a hurry would never take the time to stop and eat such a large meal. And if he was killed by outsiders, why didn't they take the copper axe. So the question remains about what happened on that final day of his life. The truth is that nobody will ever know what really happened. The iceman's murder will remain a mystery forever.</p>

<p><strong>M:</strong> Did you see the beautiful sunset tonight? It was gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> No, I didn't. But I’m surprised you even notice such things.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Really? Why are you surprised?</p>
<p><strong>W: You're so focused on your work.</strong> <em>I didn't imagine you had room in your
mind for nature.</em></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Really? Well, I just don't show it. I make a point of it to notice such things as often as I can.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> You know I think you should try to <em>show that side of yourself more often</em>. It would improve your image.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> So, you think my image needs improving.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> Well, it wouldn't hurt to be a little less formal and to smile once in a while. <em>You might also improve the way you dress, maybe with a few more warm colors.</em></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> <em>I’m afraid I don't know much about fashion design and warm colors.</em> Do you really think the way we dress influences people?</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> You must be kidding. <strong>The first impression you give is based on your
appearance and clothes. Don't you ever notice the kind of shoes someone is wearing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> Well then that explains why you were wearing such shoes always the same.</p>
<p><strong>M: No, I hardly notice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> How old are the shoes you're wearing now?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> These? I don't know probably a year old.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> And I bet you been wearing them almost every day. They look like it.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> That's right, these shoes are comfortable, and they weren't expensive. I bet yours were expensive.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> Well they were cheap<em>. I think it's important to dress right. To dress for the occasion and make a good impression.</em></p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Ok, why don't we go shopping together this weekend? You can be my fashion
advisor.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> Was it in for me?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> If I like your advice, I’ll buy you another pair of shoes. How's that?</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> Ok. But they won't be cheap. You understand that, right?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Of course. But it'll be worth it if you think my new look will improve my image.</p>
<p><strong>W:</strong> I guarantee it. <strong>With me as an advisor you can't go wrong.</strong></p>
