<h3 id="the-psychology-of-love">The psychology of love</h3>
<p>One of the most important human emotions is love. However, there are many
different kinds of love. <em>Romantic love is certainly one of the most interesting
kinds of love.</em> It can be beautiful wonderful and heartbreaking sometimes all at
the same time. <em>Romantic love can make our lives full and meaningful, but it can
also be an escape from loneliness and suffering.</em></p>
<p><strong>Other kinds of love include the love between a parent and child.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If romantic love has a purpose, neither psychology nor biology has discovered
it.</strong> <em>However</em>, throughout <em>history</em> philosophers have offered <em>opinions</em> about
it. The Greek philosopher Plato said love makes us complete. He relates a comic
story in which humans originally had 4 arms 4 legs and 2 faces<strong>. Then when they
angered the gods they were cut in half</strong>. <em>Since then every person has been
searching for their soul mate, the other half of his or herself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Another philosopher believe that love is an illusion</strong>. In his view, people
fall in love because they believe the other person can make them happy. But in
fact, this is just an illusion designed to make us have children. <em>Once we have
children we are right back to where we were still searching for happiness.</em>
Furniture this is a success because we have children to maintain our species,
but it leaves us still searching for something more.</p>
<p><strong>If something is an illusion it isn't what it seems to be.</strong></p>
<p>In Buddhism, romantic love is seen as an attempt to satisfy our desires. These
desires are a defect something we need to overcome. The way to free ourselves
from suffering is to remove desires. <strong>Once free of desires we can reach a state
of peace and wisdom</strong>. This state of being is called nirvana.</p>
<p>In one of china's greatest classical novels dream of the red chamber love is
presented as a state of foolishness. <em>A young man falls in love with a beautiful
woman who tricks and makes a full of him.</em> This results in conflicting emotions
of love and hate which tear him apart. <strong>To cure him, a priest gives him a magic
mirror.</strong> The priest tells him to look into the reverse side of the mirror but
never to look in the front side.</p>
<p>When the young man looks into the mirror he doesn't like what he sees. So he
looks into the forbidden side, the front side. There he sees the lovely image of
his love who invites him into the mirror to be with her. He does this several
times until he is finally dragged away in chains. He dies while looking into the
mirror. <em>Perhaps the point of the story is that all such attachments should be
avoided.</em></p>
<p>A famous French writer Simona de Beauvoir has another point of view. <strong>For her, love is the desire to integrate with another, like in a great friendship</strong>.
However, it is important that lovers not become too dependent on the other person. Becoming dependent on another person can lead to boredom or power games.
<em>Lovers should support each other in discovering themselves and developing their potentials.</em> <strong>In this way romantic love can enrich the world. Falling in love can be exciting and frightening. Maybe we lose ourselves and maybe we find ourselves.</strong> Will you dare to find out?</p>

<h3 id="the-teenage-years">The teenage years</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> What's so funny? What are you writing about?</p>
<p><strong>B: I’m writing about something I saw earlier this morning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Really? Do you keep a journal?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> Yes, I do. Every weekend I write about things that happens during the week.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> How long have you been doing it?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> I’ve <em>been</em> doing it <em>fairly</em> regularly <em>since</em> high school.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Are you going to turn it into a book?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> I don't know maybe I will someday but for now it's just for me.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> So, what was so interesting about what you saw this morning?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> I was in the same coffee shop I usually go to and a group of teenagers
came in. <em>I couldn't help watching them</em> and trying to hear some of their conversation.</p>
<p><strong>A: That must have been interesting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> Yes, it was. The more I watch them the more I realize how glad I am that I don't have to go through that stage of life again.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> So, it brought back some memories.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> Yes, it did. It was so <em>clear</em> how uncomfortable some of them <em>were</em>, <em>yet</em> they were pretending <em>to have</em> a good time. At least that's how it seems to me.</p>
<p><strong>A: Why do you think they were pretending?</strong></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> It was just the way they smiled and laughed. It seemed unnatural and over done as if they were bad actors.</p>
<p>A couple of the boys were really awkward around the girls and 2 of the girls were wearing too much makeup. I had to stop myself laughing.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I can imagine it. <strong>I can remember wanting to be popular when I was in high school</strong>. Now that you mention it. It wasn't a great time, though I had some fun too.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> I guess it wasn't so bad at the time, except when I was preparing for my university entrance examinations.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, that was awful. <em>My parents put tons of pressure on me, so I thought I was going to go crazy.</em></p>
<p>What about girls, did you have any girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> <em>There was one girl I had a crush on, but I thought she was interested in somebody else.</em> <strong>I didn't find out until much later that she was interested in me too.</strong> It was a lost opportunity, one of many.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Really? You should become a writer or make a movie. You have a great imagination.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> To be honest, it's much easier to imagine things than actually do things.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You can say that again.</p>
