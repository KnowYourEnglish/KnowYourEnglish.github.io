<h3 id="mysteries-of-nature">Mysteries of nature</h3>
<p>There are many mysteries in nature. Mysteries are things we don't understand such as how the Egyptian pyramids were built. In fact, we are surrounded by mysteries. What we know about the world seems like very little.   <br />
Scientists tell us that what we see in the universe is only a small part of what is there.  <br />
The rest is invisible including dark matter and dark energy.   <br />
These two unknowns make up around 95% of the universe.   <br />
Evidence for their existence comes from their effects on what we can observe, such as the motion and positions of distant galaxies.   <br />
Yet though we know very little, we are able to build airplanes and communicate with smartphones. In some ways we humans are very smart or at least we think we are. We still need to face big issues like climate change, and that is going to be a huge challenge. The challenge for humans will be our ability to adapt to a changing environment.   <br />
What about other forms of life? How do they adapt? Seasonal variations, for example, can be one of the greatest challenges for animals to overcome. Overcoming such challenges is a great achievement but hardly easy. Some birds migrate thousands of kilometers each year to deal with seasonal changes. These migrations are amazing.   <br />
Birds don't carry maps or compasses, yet they know where to go. They have developed the ability to see the earth's magnetic field. This ability is a wonder of nature. It takes advantage of the fact that the earth is like a huge bar magnet. It has a North Pole which is positive, and a South pole which is negative. Somehow the birds are able to see this magnetic field and use it to their advantage.   <br />
And even the way birds fly together is amazing. Many migrating birds flying of the formation.   <br />
They do this to conserve energy. In a V formation birds can use the energy of the birds in front of them. This energy comes from the air currents generated by the wings. Conserving energy is necessary for the birds to survive the long journey. How did the birds know this? It's truly amazing how the birds know this.     </p>
<p>Another amazing example of survival is the salmon.   <br />
Salmon spend most of their lives in the ocean, which is saltwater.   <br />
Yet, when it's time to breed, they do so in freshwater rivers.   <br />
Salmon can adapt their bodies to survive in both saltwater and freshwater.  <br />
When its breeding time they return to the same River where they were born. It seems as if they had a built-in map that guides them for hundreds of miles.     </p>
<p>Once they leave the saltwater they don't eat. They are determined to finish their journey despite the many obstacles. They swim against strong currents, jump over waterfalls, and try to escape the claws of hungry bears. Many die along the way but enough of them survive to breed and produce the next generation. Once they have laid their eggs they die having completed their journey. It seems that their purpose in life is just to reproduce.     </p>
<p>Migration takes animals to new, more favorable environments when the seasons change. some of these journeys are long and dangerous, along routes with no obvious landmarks. the longest migration is that of the Arctic tern. it flies from pole to pole twice a year. if a tern flies its average lifespan of 20 years the distance, it has flown will be equivalent to a journey to the moon and back.    </p>
<p>Humans also migrate but seldom if ever for seasonal variations. Unfortunately, human migrations are often due to human activities. Since the beginning of the 21st century, large scale migrations have become a global problem. Millions of migrants have had to leave their countries and look for new homes. Many have died along the way or left as refugees in camps until they are admitted into a new country. So the question remains as to how our global community will face these challenges.    </p>
<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
<h3 id="social-relations">Social relations</h3>
<p>To <strong>criticize</strong> someone is to point out their faults or mistakes. Some people appreciate constructive criticism which can help them develop their skills. Some people cannot take any criticism without feeling hurt.     </p>
<p>To <strong>praise</strong> someone is to let them know that they have done a good job. Some people expect to be praised when they have performed well. Knowing when and how to praise someone is an important skill.     </p>
<p>To <strong>apologize</strong> to someone is to admit that you have done something wrong or hurtful. One way to apologize is to say you are sorry. If your apology isn't accepted it means the person hasn't forgiven you. If you accidentally hurt someone it's usually a good idea to apologize.     </p>
<p>To <strong>order</strong> people to do something means to use your power or position to get them to do it. Many people dislike being ordered to do things. In many cases it's better to make a request in order someone to do something.  A boss may order his employees to do something and they will usually agree to do it, even if they don't want to.     </p>
<p>To <strong>encourage</strong> someone is to support their efforts and help build their confidence. A good teacher encourages students to do their best. To discourage someone is to take away their confidence. Some people are discouraged if they don't receive praise or recognition for their work.     </p>
<h3 id="science-vocabulary">Science vocabulary</h3>
<p>There are many different <strong>cycles</strong> in nature such as the cycle of seasons. A cycle is a series of events that repeat such as the daily cycle of light and dark. The time it takes for a cycle to repeat itself is its period.   <br />
To <strong>evolve</strong> means to change or improve over a period of time. In biology, the theory of evolution says that advanced life forms, such as humans have evolved from lower forms of life. Life forms involved because they have to adapt in order to survive.   <br />
A <strong>force</strong> of Attraction brings two objects closer together, such as the force of gravity. A force of pulsion pushes two objects away from each other, such as the force between two electrons.   <br />
<strong>Gravity</strong> is a force of attraction between two objects with mass.   <br />
To <strong>transform</strong> needs to change from one form into another. A transformation occurs when an object takes on a new appearance or structure. Over a period of time the process of evolution can transform the appearance of a species of life.   <br />
To <strong>Inherit</strong> something needs to get it without having to ask or work for it. A child from a very rich family may inherit a lot of money. Eye and hair color are inherited traits.     </p>

<p><strong>Employee W:</strong> Excuse me, do you have a minute?   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> I'm sorry, not right now. I'll be free in about 15 minutes. Could you come back then?   <br />
To be free is the opposite of busy.  <br />
<strong>Employee W:</strong> No, I'm afraid we have an emergency upstairs.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> Can’t you handle it?   <br />
<strong>Employee W:</strong> No, I think it would be best if you were there.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> OK. I’ll finish this call and be right with you.  <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> OK. what is it?   <br />
<strong>Employee W:</strong> Kevin and bob are shouting at each other and it's upsetting everyone.  <br />
To upset everyone means to make them feel uncomfortable.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> Oh. Not again. Both must have gotten to grow up. Who started it?   <br />
<strong>Employee W:</strong> I'm not sure. But they were even pushing each other.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> OK. This is unacceptable. You run on ahead and warn them that I'm coming. I want them to calm down before I get there. Can you do that?   <br />
<strong>Employee W:</strong> OK. I will do what I can to calm them down. But you know Kevin, he's such a hot head.   <br />
To calm down is the opposite of to get upset.  <br />
This isn't the first time they've had problems.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> OK. Kevin i've warned you before. This is gotta stop.   <br />
<strong>Kevin:</strong> yes, I know. But bob doesn't cooperate. He's impossible to work with.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> even so you can't go around pushing people. That's no way to handle things. If you were doing such a good job I have to let you go right now. Your behavior just isn't acceptable.  <br />
In this case to let him go means to fire him.  <br />
<strong>Kevin:</strong> yeah. I understand and I'm sorry. I just can't stand working with him.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> I'm not sure what to do. What would you do if you were me. Do you have any suggestions?   <br />
<strong>Kevin:</strong> to be honest, if I were you I wouldn't have the two of us work in the same office. I know bob has been with the company longer than I have, but he's doing a terrible job. When you are not around, he just bullies people. People are afraid of him.   <br />
<strong>Boss:</strong> OK I’ll look into it a bit more. But you got to (gotta) promise me to keep cool and not let this happen again.   <br />
<strong>Kevin:</strong> OK I’ll try to handle things differently next time.     </p>
