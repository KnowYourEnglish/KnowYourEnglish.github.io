<h3 id="at-jessicas-reunion-party">At Jessica’s reunion party</h3>
<p>Jessica's 20- year class reunion was held at a fancy hotel. When she arrived, she wasn't sure she was in the right place. At first, she didn't recognize anyone. And felt a bit awkward and out of place. But it wasn't long before a strange man came up to her. He was already losing his hair and he was wearing thick glasses. “don't you remember me ? ” he asked.    </p>
<p>When he said he was she barely remember him, especially since he had changed so much. Then he told her that he had always had a crush on her. He said she looked beautiful and he immediately took a selfie of them, with his arm tight around her waist. This made her feel a bit strange. She smiled at him and pretended to be happy to see him. But in fact, she wasn't sure how to react though he seems nice.    </p>
<p>She finally excused herself and went to the lady’s room. She was beginning to regret having come to the reunion. She had always been shy, and she still was.    </p>
<p>When she returned to the party Sharon invited her to sit at her table. Dinner was going to be served soon. And some of the classmates were going to give speeches. Sharon asked Jessica to say a few words too, because people were curious. This was a surprise. Jessica had never been very popular, and she didn't think anyone had noticed her. She had always felt like an outsider with only a couple of close friends. Still she had been one of the best students and people remembered her.    </p>
<p>As the evening wore on, Jessica began to really enjoy herself. She talked with her old friends and was amazed by how some others had changed. For example, Tom used to be good looking and athletic. He was one of the most popular students and a star basketball player. His one problem was math. He had had a hard time in math, especially in geometry. This was because he wasn't a logical thinker. Except for basketball. He didn't want to do anything unless it was easy.    </p>
<p>Tom was no longer good looking. His nose which had always been large, had grown even larger. He had also gained a lot of weight. His wife had left him, so for the first time ever, he was alone. He looks lonely and depressed, not at all like he used to be.    </p>
<p>Steve was a nobody in middle school. People hardly noticed him. He was small, quiet, and a bit ugly with crooked teeth. What he was good at was English. His English was even better than their teachers. After graduating he went to a low ranked University and eventually dropped out. For a while, he worked as a tour guide. 10 years ago, he and some friends started a little company which is now a great success. In fact, he had become a rich, generous man. He had a nice, warm smile and his success hadn’t gone to his head. It was a pleasure to be around him.    </p>
<p>Betty used to be the most beautiful girl in school. She wasn't very smart but she was a great singer. She made a video of her singing and it went viral. She became famous overnight but it only lasted for about two years. After that her fans lost interest in her. She tried to become an actress, but she failed. She had been too stiff and nervous in front of the camera.    </p>
<p>Betty had a nice husband who seemed to adore her. The one tragedy in her life happened about five years ago. When she lost her daughter to a rare form of cancer. Because it her hair had begun to turn gray. Jessica couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Who had such high hopes in tremendous energy is a girl, but things didn't work out.    </p>
<p>And then there was John. John used to be the school bully, strong and mean. He hadn't been nice to anybody. It seems that he was always angry and ready to hit someone. After graduating he joined the army and went overseas to fight in a war. He saw many people died and he grew to hate fighting of any kind. Then one day he was nearly killed. When the helicopter he was in was shot down. He survived the crash, but he lost a leg and was hospitalized for nearly a year.    </p>
<p>Now he had completely changed. He had gentle kind eyes and a beautiful smile. He was working for an organization that provides support for elderly people. From jessica's point of view John had turned out to be a wonderful surprise.    </p>
<p>In the end, Jessica was glad she went to her reunion. it was interesting to see how people had changed through the years. Still, she was happy to get home and appreciate everything that she had.    </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> What are you so excited about?  <br />
<strong>B:</strong> Have you heard? John and Sylvia are getting a divorce   <br />
<strong>A:</strong> No, I haven’t. But I am not surprised.  <br />
To be honest, I never expected their marriage to last very long. She's so aggressive and bossy.  <br />
<strong>B:</strong> Well I think John had an affair. He met someone on a business trip.     </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Really? How did you find that out?   <br />
<strong>B:</strong> Sherry told me a few minutes ago.   <br />
<strong>A:</strong> Oh Sherry. She is such a gossip. I wouldn't believe anything she says.   <br />
<strong>B:</strong> No, really. This time I think we can trust her. I don't think she's making it up.   <br />
<strong>A:</strong> Wow this is news. What about their baby?  <br />
<strong>B:</strong> I don't know. I haven't heard anything about that.   <br />
<strong>A:</strong> Well that's too bad. Even though I don't like either one of them, I feel sorry for them.   <br />
