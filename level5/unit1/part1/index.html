<h3 id="jessicas-class-reunion">Jessica’s class reunion</h3>
<p>Jessica is 35 years old. She graduated from middle school 20 years ago. This year her middle school class had its 20-year class reunion. All of her classmates and teachers were invited to attend. It was going to be at a hotel near where their school used to be. Like many other buildings the school had been torn down. It had been replaced by some apartment buildings.</p>
<p>At first, she wasn't sure if she could go to the reunion. One reason was that there wasn't anyone in particular that she wanted to see. Another reason was that she was very busy. She was a working mother with a boy 8- years old and a husband who was rarely at home. Going to the reunion meant that she would have to arrange for someone to take care of things while she was away. That wouldn't be easy. She didn't want to take her boy with her, and her husband wouldn't take time off from work.</p>
<p>Then she got a message from Sharon, one of her old classmates. Sharon was contacting people from their class and urging everyone to come. In their schooldays, Sharon was class monitor and now she was helping to organize the reunion.</p>
<p>None of them had seen or heard from her since graduation. They were especially curious since she hadn't gone to their first reunion 10 years before.</p>
<p>Jessica decided to arrange things so that she could go.</p>
<p>Her husband finally agreed to take care of things while she was away.</p>
<p>He agreed to do it because her mother had offered to come and stay for a while. So Jessica could attend the reunion.</p>
<p>Since he and her mother didn't get along, he decided to change his schedule and work from home for a few days.</p>
<p>He really didn't want her mother to come though he didn't say so.</p>
<p>When she got to the reunion, she was shocked everyone had aged so much and many were out of shape. Some who used to be good looking had lost their looks completely. And others looked much better than before. It was strange how time had changed people in such different ways. Anyway, she decided that since she was there she would try to enjoy it.</p>

W: Did anyone contact you? 
M: No, I haven't received any messages. 
W: I'm sorry to hear that Sir. I see here that the washing machine you ordered hasn't arrived in our warehouse yet. It can't be delivered until next week. 
M: You don't even have it yet?
M: Why haven't I been notified. I took time off from work to be at home today. 
W: You should have been notified by phone or email. 
M: I wasn't. I haven't received any notification. This is very upsetting. 
W: I understand Sir. I'm really sorry for this. 
M: Being sorry isn't enough. I'm really upset. This is no way to do business. 
W: Yes, I understand. I can send you a $50 gift coupon as a way to express our appreciation for your patience. 
M: I don't care about the money. I don't blame you of course, but I want you to know how disappointed I am with ace. I expected much better service. 
W: I'm really sorry Sir. Is there anything else I can do for you? 
M: Yes, there is. I'd like to cancel the order and get a refund. 
W: I'm sorry to hear that Sir. But I understand. I'll see to it that you get your refund. 
M: How long will it take before I get the refund? 
W: You should see the credit on your next month's credit card billing statement. 
M: Thanks for your help. 
W: You're welcome Sir. and once again, please accept my apologies.  </p></div>
