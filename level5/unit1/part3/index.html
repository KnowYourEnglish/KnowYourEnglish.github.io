<p>Emma's best is a small but growing health food company.  <br />
It was started in 1995 by a married couple who were tired of working for large companies.  <br />
The two founders were Ed and Emma Smith, both health conscious vegetarians. Despite the risks Ed and Emma wanted to start their own business.  <br />
<strong>They knew it would be hard work, but they were determined to try.</strong>  <br />
Their plan was to create a business that provided healthy food to busy people. They wanted it to be something they could be proud of.  <br />
When they started the company, organic food was becoming more popular. <strong>People were becoming more food conscious and worried about food safety.</strong> In fact, people were willing to pay higher prices for food that was free of harmful chemicals. In addition, an increasing number of people had little time to go shopping and cook at home. They wanted meals that were healthy but easy to prepare. There were very few frozen meals available at the time, and none of them were vegetarian or organic. There was a gap in the market.    </p>
<p>Ed and Emma immediately saw the opportunity and lunch there first product. It was a frozen pasta meal with a mix of vegetables and a delicious cream sauce. The market response was enthusiastic and profitable beyond their expectations. <strong>Their product was an instant success. </strong>To their surprise it was soon being eaten by millions of people, not only vegetarians are those interested in organic foods. It was being bought, because it was easy to prepare, and it tasted good. And of course, it was healthy.    </p>
<p>Other products followed in rapid succession.  <br />
As a result, at the end of 5 years the company was producing over 100 frozen meals.  <br />
Since then they have increased the number of meals to over 150, including pizzas sandwiches, and snacks.  <br />
Their foods are carried by natural food stores and supermarkets throughout north America.    </p>
<p>Although they have expanded their production facilities and increase the number of employees, they have remained a private company. They enjoy the fact that they are family owned business. Sensitive to the needs of their customers, they don't have to worry about pleasing shareholders. Rather than paying dividends to shareholders, Emma's best has a profit sharing plan that benefits its employees.    </p>
<p><strong>Bonuses and salary increases keep employees happy and motivated to work hard.</strong> As a result, employee turnover is low, and the company has been recognized as one of the best companies to work for. In addition, Emma’s best supports local charities, especially those that provide healthy food to children from low-income families. Given its success, the company feels an obligation to contribute to society. In spite of the fact that other companies now produce similar products. Emma’s best remains the market leader. Their total commitment to quality has made the difference and they are proud of their accomplishments.    </p>
